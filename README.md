Identifying, Summarizing, and Analyzing Research Papers

## Goals:
- **Data Collection:** Gather research papers in the specified domain. This could involve using APIs of research databases like PubMed, arXiv, etc.
- **Paper Classification:** Use a machine learning model to classify papers as either seminal or state-of-the-art. This could be based on factors like citation count, recency, etc.
- **Summarization:** Use a language model to generate summaries of the papers. This could involve both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.
- **Dataset Identification:** Use NLP techniques to identify mentions of benchmark datasets in the papers.
- **Expert Identification:** Analyze authorship and citation data to identify leading experts in the domain.
